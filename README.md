# Problem it is addressing to?
The problem Wali is addressing is multifaceted: it's about enhancing the shopping experience for individuals who face challenges like visual impairment or reluctance to seek help. By leveraging emerging technologies like smart vision, QR code scanning, and AI-driven chatbot, Wali offers an inclusive solution. It empowers users to independently access information about store products, including names, quantities, discounts, and prices. The integration of a product detector and speech synthesis further ensures a seamless experience for visually impaired users. Through these innovations, Wali not only provides convenience but also promotes inclusivity, enabling individuals to overcome obstacles and engage in shopping with confidence and autonomy.


#How did we build it?
Wali employs a holistic approach to address the identified challenges. It leverages smart vision technology, enabled by a pretrained COCOSSD model, to detect and recognize products placed in front of the camera. This allows users, especially those with visual impairments, to effortlessly access real-time information about items in the store. The integration of QR code scanning streamlines the process further, enabling users to obtain comprehensive details about a specific product by simply scanning its QR code.

Additionally, Wali's use of speech synthesis enhances accessibility by converting textual information into clear and audible output. This audio representation of product details enables visually impaired users to independently understand the items' names, quantities, discounts, and prices.

The application's AI-driven chatbot, built using OpenAI's API and Langchain, serves as a knowledgeable virtual assistant. It engages users in natural language conversations, providing real-time responses to queries related to pricing, availability, discounts, and even product locations within the store. This feature reduces the need for external assistance, empowering users to navigate the shopping experience autonomously.

By combining these technologies, Wali creates a seamless and inclusive shopping environment. It not only caters to the practical needs of its users but also addresses emotional and psychological barriers, allowing individuals to shop comfortably without the fear of embarrassment or the challenges posed by visual impairments. Wali's comprehensive solution transforms the shopping landscape, making it more accessible, efficient, and user-centered.
